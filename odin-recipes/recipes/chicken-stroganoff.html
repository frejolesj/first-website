    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Greek seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and mushrooms. Reduce heat; cook and stir until onions release their liquid and mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season chicken strips with Greek seasoning and black pepper. Place chicken in the skillet; cook and stir over medium heat until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth, milk, and Worcestershire sauce into skillet; slowly stir in sour cream, a tablespoonful at a time. Spoon out a small amount of sauce and whisk with flour in a small bowl until smooth. Stir flour mixture back into sauce; simmer until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and ground black pepper. Serve over egg noodles; garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
